# About Project 
In this project, I analyzed customer purchase behavior for Walmart Inc., focusing on purchase amounts in relation to gender and various factors. The objective was to determine whether spending habits differed between male and female customers, particularly during the Black Friday shopping period, using a dataset that included 50 million male and 50 million female customers.

Utilizing statistical methods such as confidence intervals and the central limit theorem, I conducted a comprehensive analysis that revealed significant gender-specific spending trends. The insights derived from this analysis were instrumental in guiding Walmart's marketing and engagement strategies, enabling more informed business decisions aimed at optimizing outcomes.
